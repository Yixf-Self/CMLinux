# 01 - localhost

***DO NOT USE UBUNTU x86_64 12.02+ as the localhost, there exists a series of fatal errors in pending cross-compile***. You may put a `VM` first with `Cent OS`, which may help you avoid many mistakes.

-  At the begining of the building process, you may first check your localhost with the packages and settings. All process below are carried out on `Ununtu 16.04`, if you are using `rpm` based distributions, you may only change the `apt-get` into `yum`, `dpkg` into `rpm` and so on.If you have the experience of deploying a Linux into your localhost, it is easy to complete the basic steps.Fix the problems by installing the packages and make the links right.
```bash
    ./scripts/version-check.sh | grep not```
\* For the `Ubuntu` users, the default link of `sh` may be `/bin/sh -> dash`, run `sudo dpkg-reconfigure dash` to re-configure it. 

- Make a dedicated partition for our tiny Linux, the minimal system requires a partition of `4GB` fir storing all the source tarballs and compiling the packages, use `df` to see your status of storages.
```bash
    df -h
```
Use `fdisk` to modify the partration table and create mounting process, you should be cautious on modifying the `fstab`.
```bash
    man fdisk
```
Recommend using the ext3/ext4 as the format.
If you are more satisfied with the X Window (init 5), it is much safer by using `GParted`.
- Install the `Oracle VirtualBox` to create a VM for test and deploy.
```bash
    sudo apt-get install virtualbox
```
As the test field of our Linux, you may create a VM with a storage at least 10GB.
```bash
    export LFS=<Your dir of the LFS>
```
Export the environment variable, and the variable `LFS` will be used several times. You should ensure that this variable is always defined throughout the LFS build process.
Recommending write it in the .bash_profile 
```bash
    echo "export LFS=<Your dir of the LFS>" >> ~/.bash_profile;. ~/.bash_profile
```
 You may comlete the process not only in your home dir, but also the superuser's.
-  Retrieve all the source packages recommending for or building process, the list of which lies in `/resources/src_pkg.list`, you may use wget the list of URLs to make it easier.In addition to the packages, several patches are also required. These patches correct any mistakes in the packages that should be fixed by the maintainer. The patches also make small modifications to make the packages easier to work with.
```bash
    sudo mkdir -v $LFS/sources
    sudo chmod -v a+wt $LFS/sources
    wget --input-file=./resources/src_pkg_wget.list --continue --directory-prefix=$LFS/sources
    wget --input-file=./resources/src_patch_wget.list --continue --directory-prefix=$LFS/sources
```
- For the last process of the localhost preparing, you may create a directory in $LFS for the installation of the temporary tools, add an unprivileged user to reduce risk, and create an
appropriate build environment for that user. Please run the commands in **su** mode
```bash
    mkdir -v $LFS/tools
    ln -sv $LFS/tools /
    groupadd lfs
    useradd -s /bin/bash -g lfs -m -k /dev/null lfs
    passwd lfs # Give the user lfs a passwd
    chown -v lfs $LFS/tools
    chown -v lfs $LFS/sources
```
Change your user into **lfs**, and we shall prepare some bash profiles.
```bash
    su - lfs
    echo "exec env -i HOME=$HOME TERM=$TERM PS1='\u:\w\$ ' /bin/bash" > ~/.bash_profile
    echo "set +h
```
Make a `.bashrc` profile for user `lfs` initializting with these setting lines, you may `echo` the list into `~/.bashrc` like `echo <list> > ~/.bashrc` to create it
```bash
    umask 022
    LFS=***<Your Directory of lfs locol>***
    LC_ALL=POSIX
    LFS_TGT=$(uname -m)-lfs-linux-gnu
    PATH=/tools/bin:/bin:/usr/bin
    export LFS LC_ALL LFS_TGT PATH
```
Finally, to have the environment fully prepared for building the temporary tools, source the just-created user profile:
```bash
    . ~/.bash_profile
```

***Now, you have completed all the preparing process for the localhost, well done.***
